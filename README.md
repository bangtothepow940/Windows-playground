# Windows-playground
An little software for fun that adds misc things!

# This adds:
-Random number
-Cursor teleportation
-Two pictures for some reason
-A clock
-Message box and TTS for text you want
-Progress bar
-Track bar

-Issues:
-
-Some antiviruses can detect this as a virus (and this software is NOT a virus, trust me(It's maybe the cursor teleporting script))

Have fun!
